Started The Odin Project *9/10/21* and made this project 9/13/21. Added CSS 10/8/21.

Pretty much just a review of what I learned twenty years ago, but a nice review with a few changes now that HTML 5 is around. Trying to remember semantic web points I learned back then too in terms of structure, alt tags, etc but at a verrry basic level. Will add CSS later maybe to make it purty.
